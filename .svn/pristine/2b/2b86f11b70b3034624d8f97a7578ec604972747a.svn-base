00:18:26.91 the white bone shown against a letter read
00:18:30.99 caution at the head nor Damone behind him and the lander felt nauseated himself
00:18:37.22 and believes he said slowing and make it quite
00:18:41.25 and then they bent over the woman of lying on the thrill tie to a chair
00:18:46.24 with that tighter up agreed in noose around a scrawny knack

00:26:40.59 the land and drove back and forth: up a few times
00:26:44.34 there were lights in the windows but no one was out and about
00:26:47.82 one with a kind of thing when they found out
00:26:50.84 he was feeling uneasy
00:26:52.71 and confronted with the old woman that the noose around and make it fit in the cruelty of it was unthinkable
00:26:58.99 who would do something like that when a hitter over the head of the Max so it would all be over in an instant white torture
00:27:06.95 the dried to plan the investigation in his head as he drove slowly through the village
00:27:11.59 and the crossroads to load spent out he stopped turned up the senate, because it was cold and then sat motionless is enough to load the horizon
00:27:21.88 the was the one would have to lead the investigation he knew that no one else was even possible
00:27:27.52 up to lead them he was the criminal detective in east a Nevada most experience despite the fact that it was only 42 years old

00:27:44.75 that anyone seen anything suspicious anything unusual the questions are already running through his mind
00:27:50.82 and the land and you from experience that from robberies are often difficult to solve
00:27:55.73 what he can hope for most of the old woman 1 to 5 she had seen what happened feed you
00:28:02.54 that if he died a double murder would be even hotter to solve
00:28:07.30 the felt uneasy bond a normal circumstances this unease would have spread integrated energy and activity
00:28:13.70 to cease with the prerequisites for all police work the imagined that he was a good policemen
00:28:20.00 but right now the front uncertain and tired

00:28:26.13 the car rolled a few Mages and he stopped again
00:28:30.56 it was iffy only now realized what he had witnessed on that frozen winter morning
00:28:36.42 the senselessness and savagery of the attack on the hopeless couple scared him
00:28:41.27 something happened that shouldn't have
00:28:43.39 not here
00:28:45.12 the lookout of the car window
00:28:47.22 the wind was rushing and was three under tools
00:28:50.77 and have to get started in filled
00:28:53.44 its Azevedo said it got to find whoever did this

00:29:31.91 why you sitting out here went in the room
00:29:34.75 date set that tell me if anything happened
00:29:37.57 the land and notice that Martinson was starting to feel unsure of himself
00:29:42.09 and some of the grumpy schoolteacher he filled
00:29:45.23 carefully pushed open the door and looked in
00:29:48.16 the alias machines was sucking in pumping in deaths waiting room two weeks until a kid like transparent lands along the walls

00:30:42.49 we can't tell yet the extent of the internal injuries she may have suffered
00:30:46.34 the three have to see whether survives
00:30:48.66 that the windpipe has been severely traumatized
00:30:51.06 as if someone tried to strangle a
00:30:53.37 that's exactly what happened to them and are looking at the thin face visible among the sheets and tubes
00:30:59.57 she shouldn't guide to the Dr.
00:31:02.37 May hope she survives to them and she's the only witness we've got
00:31:07.47 we hope all a patient's of life that I the Dr. Stanley studying the monitor where green alliance moved in uninterrupted waves
00:31:16.01 the lander left the room after the Dr. insisted that he could tell you nothing mall
00:31:20.35 the prognosis was uncertain
00:31:22.31 the DNA of play and might die without regaining consciousness
00:31:25.74 it was no way to know
00:31:28.69 can you agreed the lander us the cadet
00:31:32.28 know and often applied in supplies
00:31:35.90 that's too bad to the land and left
00:31:39.69 them the hospital he drove to the browned police station that lie on the road out to load the east end of the town
00:31:45.74 the sat down at his desk and looked out of the window of repeal read water,
00:31:51.43 namely the times require another kind of policemen he filled policemen who want distressed when they're forced to go into a human slaughter us in the Swedish countryside and early in the January morning
00:32:02.78 policemen and don't suffer from my uncertainty and anguish
00:32:07.47 the sorts were interrupted by the telephone
00:32:09.94 the hospital ethos that once the calling to say that Maria the plane is dead
00:32:14.31 at teach you wake up did she say anything
00:32:17.04 the stead of the ringing telephone time he filled time anything but that
00:32:23.86 but when he picked up the receiver it was a store to
00:32:26.69 the gala start an almost up the phone on the thrill
00:32:29.80 up that she said any head the: dropping into the pay phone
00:32:34.47 and low he said way you calling from

00:32:50.23 that as wetlands on in the train station on leaving out I just wanted to tell you that at least I thought about senior
00:32:57.68 and the conversation was cut off and he was left sitting there with the receiver in his hand
00:33:03.58 it was like holding something to add something hacked off
00:33:06.98 that debt and kid he filled
00:33:09.28 why does she do things like this
00:33:12.12 the daughter Linda was 19
00:33:14.35 until she was 15 their relationship had been good
00:33:17.56 to get him rather than to a mother when she had a problem when it was something she really wanted to do but didn't quite pair
00:33:24.81 the Encino metamorphose from a chubby little go to a young woman with a defiant beauty before she was 15 she never gave any hint that she was carrying around secret demons
00:33:34.79 that one day would try the into a precarious and inscrutable landscape

00:34:05.27 Boston roots when it was all over the Dr. told the land and that she would have died if he had and coming when he did and how the presence of mind to apply pressure bandages
00:34:14.70 he can get over the shop all contact between him and Linda was broken off she pulled away and Deanna manage to understand what intranet to attempt suicide
00:34:25.23 when she finished school sheet of the string of all jobs and would abruptly disappear for long periods of time
00:34:31.14 to ice is life and Preston to report a missing is colleagues that scene is pain when Linda became the subject of his own investigation
00:34:39.15 but then she would reappear and the only way he can follow our travels was to go through a pockets only through a passport on the sly
00:34:47.38 panel he filled I didn't use steady on to change your mind
