these forgotten something the nose of the show when he wakes up
something he dreamt during the night for something he want to remember
the tries to remember
that sleep is like a black hole the whale that reveals nothing of its contents
at least I didn't dream about the balls he thinks
then I would've been hot and sweaty as if I'd suffered through a fever during the night
this time the ball was left knee and eight

the stretches out one hand tentatively enter the touches his wife's face
with his fingertips he can feel that she's wont

for 40 years that undid it was the only piece of furniture the ball when they got married
it's also the only bad they love of
the convene his left knee 18 as he crosses the wooden floor to the window
paneled he thinks old and worn out
every morning when I wake up unsurprised all over again that I'm 70 years old
the looks out into the win tonight
it's the 7th of January 1990 and no snow has fallen in scorn of this winter
and land outside the kitchen door kost it's go across the odd that that chestnut tree and the fields beyond
the squints to load the neighboring from within the planes and if
the long no white house's got the stable in the corner against the Hamas has a pale yellow mound above its back till
that's where the man stands in a stool and that's wishing when these uneasily at night when something distant a

the bed creeks kind in
on the dealing not as his life go back to sleep
in a bloody Sunday is stretching my legs
in June 13 and now
can come back to bed and stunned a freezing impact called
the years to turn over onto a side
wants we loved each other he thinks
but the shield himself from his own filled
that's two no below would love
is not for the likes of us someone would be enough, from one of what he is
was lived every day ballad over the heavy scrawny and clay does not use the word love when he talks about his wife
and I will use low was always been something totally different
the looks of the neighbor's house PM and trying to penetrate the darkness of the win tonight
when he he thinks
Wendy and you still so I know that everything's alright
so I can hide under the quilt for a little while longer
than that I had crippled from Wednesday's voluntary the enough eighties
the realizes that he's looking at the kitchen window of the neighbor's house
believes he is his custom occasional glance at his neighbor's window
now something looks different
on to suggest the darkness that's confusing in
the blink some cons to 20 to rest his eyes
than he looks of the window again
and now he sure that it's opened
a window that is always an inclusive night is opened
and the man has and when the ditto
the man has and we need because of the plane hasn't taken his usual nightly walk to the stable when his prostate packed up and rising out of his warm bed
on just imagining things
he says to himself and I said county everything he says he policies
after what could happen here in the village and not just north of cotton lake on the wake of the cult had a home make writing hard disk on a
nothing ever happens here time stands still in the scrimmage where life flows along like a creek without figure our intent
the only people who live here a few old from this will solve the least of them and to someone else
we have here and wait for the inevitable
the looks of the kitchen window one small and things that neither Marie Emily Hine a slew of cutting wood failed to close it
with age comes a sense of dread the more on morale oaks and no one forgets to close the window before nightfall
the code is to live in fear the dread of something menacing that you felt when you what a child attends when you can tell
by could get dressed and go out he thinks
Abel through the odd with the winter wind in my face up to the fence that separates up properties
I could see close to that just imagining things
that he doesn't move
to the Ins will be getting headed back to make coffee
phrase to 10 on the light in the bottom and light indicated
everything will be the way to we cease
the stands by the window and realizes that his freezing
he thinks about Medea and Johannes
we've had a married to attend two he thinks as neighbors Sanders from as
we hugged each other to a ballot ships and the baggies
that we share the good times to no
together we celebrated made some a pretty good Christmas dinner
that children went back and forth between the two from says if they belong to box
and only Schering annulment on a years of O8
without knowing why he opened the window carefully so as not to wait,
the hold on tight to the lax over the gusty wind a window intended out of his hand
and the night is completed, and he calls that the weather report on the radio and said nothing about a storm approaching over the scrawny and playing
the starry sky is clear that his family called
these just about to close the window again when he thinks he has a sound
it listens and turned with his left ear to load the open window
is good here not he's right that was damaged by all the time he spent cooped up in stuffy lumbering track codes
and that he thinks a night bed: he
suddenly is afraid I don't know if EOB is in season
it sounds like somebody shouting
and despair tried to be head of lease that knows it has to penetrate thick stone walls to catch the attention of the neighbors
on inaction things he thinks
there's nobody shouting and hit game
the Shuster windows so hot that it makes a flop or jump and Hannah wakes up
would keep giving she says that he can hear that she's annoyed
that it applies he feels show that enter Israel
and medicine when he and he says sitting down on the edge of the bed and the police kitchen window is wide open
and someone who shelled and
she sits up in bed
1227
the dozen one to answer but now the show that it wasn't a bad that he had
its your highness only at the same as one of them is calling for help
she gets out of bed and goes over to the window and begin why'd she stands then the white nightgown and looks out into the dark
kitchen window isn't open to list as
it slashed
the goes over to an IE so cold that he shaking
to some point out hope
she sets and a voice Cuevas
which we tend
the wealthy and she replies curry up
and put his dangerous up we can't have that best friends
the dresses quickly takes that old from the kitchen cupboard next to the cokes and coffee cans
and outside the play's frozen under his feet
and he turns around the catches a glimpse of how not in the window
at the friends he stopped
everything is quiet
now he conceived of the kitchen window is broken
courses he climbs over the no friends and approaches the White House
but no voice call stand
by and just imagine things
he thinks I'm an old man who can't figure out what's really happening any mall
and guided dream about the bulls last night the balls that I would dream would charge and Courtney when I was a Pawlak making you realize that someday I would die
and he is the cry
its weak more like a Moon
it's Maria
the goes over to the bedroom window and peaks cautiously through the gap between the cut in the window frame
suddenly he knows that your highness is dead
he signed his tote inside imprints of the 44th a sense of them up
and areas crumbled up on the thrill tried to a chair
and faces bloody into false teeth libra open a stack of nightgown
all we can see if Johannes is a fraud and rest of his body is hidden by the cut in
the limbs back and climbs over the fence again
these and he takes as he stumbles desperately across the frozen play
trustee calls the police
and the Texas Globe of from the closet that smells of mothballs
lady at the DOS and you don't need to see this
what happened to us kiss with key is to frighten her eyes I don't know he says
that I woke up because the mail was a name in the night
I know that's the issue on
