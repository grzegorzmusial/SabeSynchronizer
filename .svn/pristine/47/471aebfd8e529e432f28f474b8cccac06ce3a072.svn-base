00:05:21:08 the only people who live here a few old from this will solve the least of them and to someone else
00:05:27:36 we have here and wait for the inevitable
00:05:31:63 the looks of the kitchen window one small and things that neither Marie Emily Hine a slew of cutting wood failed to close it
00:05:38:92 with age comes a sense of dread the more on morale oaks and no one forgets to close the window before nightfall
00:05:47:31 the code is to live in fear the dread of something menacing that you felt when you what a child attends when you can tell
00:05:56:89 by could get dressed and go out he thinks
00:05:59:87 Abel through the odd with the winter wind in my face up to the fence that separates up properties

00:06:51:01 and only Schering annulment on a years of O8
00:06:56:52 without knowing why he opened the window carefully so as not to wait,
00:07:02:29 the hold on tight to the lax over the gusty wind a window intended out of his hand
00:07:07:56 and the night is completed, and he calls that the weather report on the radio and said nothing about a storm approaching over the scrawny and playing
00:07:16:35 the starry sky is clear that his family called
00:07:20:14 these just about to close the window again when he thinks he has a sound
00:07:24:03 it listens and turned with his left ear to load the open window
00:07:28:08 is good here not he's right that was damaged by all the time he spent cooped up in stuffy lumbering track codes
00:07:35:25 and that he thinks a night bed: he
00:07:39:42 suddenly is afraid I don't know if EOB is in season
00:07:45:03 it sounds like somebody shouting
00:07:47:48 and despair tried to be head of lease that knows it has to penetrate thick stone walls to catch the attention of the neighbors
00:07:55:71 on inaction things he thinks
00:07:58:32 there's nobody shouting and hit game
00:08:02:16 the Shuster windows so hot that it makes a flop or jump and Hannah wakes up
00:08:07:26 would keep giving she says that he can hear that she's annoyed
00:08:11:66 that it applies he feels show that enter Israel
00:08:16:55 and medicine when he and he says sitting down on the edge of the bed and the police kitchen window is wide open
00:08:24:36 and someone who shelled and
00:08:26:49 she sits up in bed
00:08:28:33 1227

00:09:15:76 the dresses quickly takes that old from the kitchen cupboard next to the cokes and coffee cans
00:09:21:25 and outside the play's frozen under his feet
00:09:24:39 and he turns around the catches a glimpse of how not in the window
00:09:28:32 at the friends he stopped
00:09:30:57 everything is quiet
00:09:32:40 now he conceived of the kitchen window is broken
00:09:36:36 courses he climbs over the no friends and approaches the White House
00:09:41:07 but no voice call stand
