Result StandardOutput:	
00:11:20.57 Chapter Two.The incoming telephone call was recorded by the Ystad police at 5:13 AM. 1
00:11:22.65  It was taken by an exhausted officer who had been on duty almost without a break since New Year�s Eve. 2
00:11:32.87  He had listened to the stammering voice on the phone and thought that it was just some deranged senior citizen. 3
00:11:39.01  But something had sparked his attention nevertheless. 4
00:11:52.14  He started asking questions. When the conversation was over, he hesitated for just a moment before lifting the receiver again and dialing a number he knew by heart.Kurt Wallander was asleep. He had stayed up far too long the night before, listening to recordings of Maria Callas that a good friend had sent him from Bulgaria. 5
00:12:01.36  Again and again he had returned to her Traviata, and it was close to two AM before he finally went to bed. 6
00:12:12.59  By the time the ring of the telephone roused him from sleep, he was deep in an intense erotic dream. 7
00:12:15.97  As if to assure himself that he had only been dreaming, he reached out and felt the covers next to him. 8
00:12:23.69  But he was alone in the bed. Neither his wife, who had left him three months earlier, nor the black woman with whom he had just been making fierce love in his dream, was present. 9
00:12:29.17 He looked at the clock as he reached for the phone. 10
00:12:31.95  A car crash, he thought instantly. 11
00:12:34.45  Treacherous ice and someone driving too fast and then spinning off E14. 12
00:12:39.40  Or trouble with refugees arriving on the morning ferry from Poland. 13
00:12:43.73 He scooted up in bed and pressed the receiver to his cheek, feeling the sting of his unshaven skin.�Wallander. 14
00:12:49.26 �I hope I didn�t wake you.�No, damn it. 15
00:12:54.79  I�m awake. 16
00:13:04.53 Why do I lie? he thought. 17
00:13:12.93  Why don�t I just say it like it is? That all I want is to go back to sleep and recapture a fleeting dream in the form of a naked woman. 18
00:13:19.13 �I thought I should call you. 19
00:13:22.90 �Traffic accident?�.�No, not exactly. An old farmer called and said his name was Nystr�m. 20
00:13:31.58  Lives in Lenarp. 21
00:13:34.03  He claimed that the woman next door was tied up on the floor and that someone was dead. 22
00:13:39.54 Wallander thought quickly about where Lenarp was located. Not so far from Marsvinsholm, in a region that was unusually hilly for Sk�ne. 23
00:13:47.34 �It sounded serious. I thought it best to call you at home. 24
00:13:55.23 �Who have you got at the station right now?�.�Peters and Nor�n are out looking for someone who broke a window at the Continental. 25
00:14:09.14  Shall I call them?�. 26
00:14:24.85 �Tell them to drive out to the crossroads between Kade Lake and Katsl�sa and wait there till I show up. 27
00:14:34.91  Give them the address. 28
00:14:45.02  When did the call come in?�.�A few minutes ago. 29
00:15:20.52 �Sure it wasn�t just some drunk calling?�. 30
00:15:24.99 �Didn�t sound like it.�Huh. 31
00:15:29.40  All right then.Wallander dressed quickly without showering, poured himself a cup of the lukewarm coffee that was still in the thermos, and looked out the window. 32
00:15:40.75  He lived on Mariagatan in central Ystad, and the fa�ade of the building across from him was cracked and gray. 33
00:15:46.38  He wondered fleetingly whether there would be any snow in Sk�ne this winter. 34
00:15:50.88  He hoped not. 35
00:15:52.94  Scanian snowstorms always brought periods of uninterrupted drudgery. Car wrecks, snowbound women going into labor, isolated old people, and downed power lines. 36
00:15:58.48  With the snowstorms came chaos, and he felt ill equipped to meet the chaos this winter. 37
00:16:14.10  The anxiety of his wife leaving him still burned inside him. 38
00:16:18.56 He drove down Regementsgatan until he came out on Osterleden. 39
00:16:22.97  At Dragongatan he was stopped by a red light, and he turned on the car radio to listen to the news. 40
00:16:29.14  An excited voice was talking about a plane that had crashed on some far-off continent.A time to live and a time to die, he thought as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes. 41
00:16:44.53  He had adopted this incantation many years ago. 42
00:16:46.88  Back then he was a young policeman cruising the streets in his home town of Malm�. 43
00:16:54.83  A drunk had suddenly pulled out a big butcher knife as he and his partner were trying to take him away in the squad car from Pildamm Park. 44
00:17:01.65  Wallander was stabbed deep, right next to his heart. A few millimeters were all that saved him from an unexpected death. 45
00:17:06.22  He had been twenty-three then, suddenly profoundly aware of what it meant to be a cop. 46
00:17:09.44  The incantation was his way of fending off the memories. 47
00:17:14.29 He drove out of the city, passing the newly built furniture warehouse at the edge of town, and caught a glimpse of the sea in the distance. 48
00:17:18.44  It was gray but oddly quiet for the middle of the Scanian winter. Far off toward the horizon there was the silhouette of a ship heading east. 49
00:17:27.54 The snowstorms are on their way, he thought. 50
00:17:30.42 Sooner or later they�ll be upon us. 51
00:17:34.08 He shut off the car radio and tried to concentrate on what was in store for him. 52
00:17:44.63 What did he know, really?. 53
00:17:52.91 An old woman, tied up on the floor? A man who claimed he saw her through a window? Wallander sped up after he passed the turnoff to Bj�re Lake and thought that it was undoubtedly an old man who was struck by a sudden flare-up of senility. 54
00:17:56.85  In his many years on the force he had seen more than once how old, isolated people would call the police as a desperate cry for help. 55
00:18:02.46 The squad car was waiting for him at the side road toward Kade Lake. 56
00:18:10.00  Peters had climbed out and was watching a hare bounding back and forth out in a field. 57
00:18:15.80 When he saw Wallander approaching in his blue Peugeot, he raised his hand in greeting and got in behind the wheel. 58
00:18:18.81 The frozen gravel crunched under the car tires. 59
00:18:26.91  Kurt Wallander followed the police car. 60
00:18:30.99  They passed the turnoff toward Trunnerup and continued up some steep hills until they came to Lenarp. 61
00:18:37.22  They swung onto a narrow dirt road that was hardly more than a tractor rut. 62
00:18:41.25  After a kilometer they were there. Two farms next to each other, two whitewashed farmhouses, and carefully tended gardens. 63
00:18:46.24 An elderly man came hurrying toward them. 64
00:18:52.28  Wallander saw that he was limping, as if one knee was bothering him. 65
00:19:04.70 When Wallander got out of the car he noticed that the wind had started to blow. 66
00:19:09.61  Maybe the snow was on the way after all.As soon as he saw the old man he knew that something truly unpleasant awaited him. 67
00:19:15.59  In the man�s eyes shone a horror that could not be imaginary.�I broke open the door,� he repeated feverishly, over and over. 68
00:19:22.33  �I broke open the door because I had to see. 69
00:19:25.40  But she�ll be dead soon too. 70
00:19:28.12 They went in through the broken door. 71
00:19:30.89  Wallander was met by a pungent old-man smell. 72
00:19:34.50  The wallpaper was old-fashioned, and he was forced to squint to be able to see anything in the dim light. 73
00:19:37.33 �So what happened here?� he asked. 74
00:19:40.73 �In there,� replied the old man. 75
00:19:44.56 Then he started to cry.The three policemen looked at each other. 76
00:19:47.86 Wallander pushed open the door with one foot.It was worse than he had imagined. 77
00:19:53.74  Much worse. Later he would say that it was the worst he had ever seen. 78
00:20:07.83  And he had seen plenty. 79
00:20:09.80 The old couple�s bedroom was soaked in blood. 80
00:20:14.80  It had even splashed onto the porcelain lamp hanging from the ceiling. 81
00:20:18.46  Prostrate across the bed lay an old man with no shirt on and his long underwear pulled down. 82
00:20:24.67  His face was crushed beyond recognition. 83
00:20:26.88  It looked as though someone had tried to cut off his nose. His hands were tied behind his back and his left thigh was shattered. 84
00:20:34.00  The white bone shone against all that red. 85
00:20:36.44 �Oh shit,� he heard Nor�n moan behind him, and Wallander felt nauseated himself. 86
00:20:43.10 �Ambulance,� he said, swallowing. �Hurry up. 87
00:20:46.84 Then they bent over the woman, half-lying on the floor, tied to a chair. 88
00:20:52.91  Whoever tied her up had rigged a noose around her scrawny neck. She was breathing feebly, and Wallander yelled at Peters to find a knife. 89
00:20:59.59  They cut off the thin rope that was digging deep into her wrists and neck, and laid her gently on the floor. 90
00:21:05.43  Wallander held her head on his knee. 91
00:21:10.50 He looked at Peters and realized that they were both thinking the same thing. 92
00:21:17.25  Who could have been cruel enough to do this? Tying a noose on a helpless old woman.�Wait outside,� said Wallander to the sobbing old man standing in the doorway. 93
00:21:27.49  �Wait outside and don�t touch anything. 94
00:21:36.84 He could hear that his voice sounded like a roar. 95
00:21:39.61 I�m yelling because I�m scared, he thought. 96
00:21:43.81  What kind of world are we living in?. 97
00:21:47.72 Almost twenty minutes passed before the ambulance arrived. The woman�s breathing grew more and more irregular, and Wallander was starting to worry that it might come too late. 98
00:21:56.37 He recognized the ambulance driver, who was named Antonson.His assistant was a young man he had never seen before. 99
00:22:02.30 �Hi,� said Wallander. 100
00:22:08.13  �He�s dead. But the woman here is alive. 101
00:22:12.72  Try to keep her that way. 102
00:22:16.43 �What happened?� asked Antonson.�I hope she�ll be able to tell us, if she makes it. 103
00:22:21.83  Hurry up now!�. 104
00:22:35.71 When the ambulance had vanished down the gravel road, Wallander and Peters went outside. 105
00:22:40.98  Nor�n was wiping his face with a handkerchief. 106
00:22:54.05  The dawn was slowly approaching. 107
00:22:59.20  Wallander looked at his wristwatch. 108
00:23:02.98  Seven twenty-eight.�It�s a slaughterhouse in there,� said Peters. 109
00:23:07.83 �Worse,� replied Wallander. 110
00:23:20.23  �Call in and request a full team. Tell Nor�n to seal off the area. 111
00:23:26.51  I�m going to talk to the old man. 112
00:23:30.17 Just as he said that, he heard something that sounded like a scream. 113
00:23:31.63  He jumped, and then the scream came again. 114
00:23:35.31 It was a horse whinnying. 115
00:23:37.89 They went over to the stable and opened the door. 116
00:23:39.43  Inside in the dark a horse was rustling in its stall. 117
00:23:55.35  The place smelled of warm manure and urine. 118
00:23:57.66 �Give the horse some water and hay,� said Wallander. 119
00:23:59.76  �Maybe there are other animals here too.When he emerged from the stable he gave a shudder. 120
00:24:03.95  Black birds were screeching in a lone tree far out in a field. 121
00:24:07.46  He sucked the cold air into his throat and noticed that the wind was picking up. 122
00:24:10.56 �Your name is Nystr�m,� he said to the man, who by now had stopped weeping. �You have to tell me what happened here. 123
00:24:22.65  If I understand correctly, you live in the house next door. 124
00:24:25.87 The man nodded. 125
00:24:27.17  �What happened here?� he asked in a quavering voice. 126
00:24:32.32 �That�s what I�m hoping you can tell me,� said Wallander. 127
00:24:37.60  �Maybe we could go into your house. 128
00:24:46.48 In the kitchen a woman in an old-fashioned dressing gown sat slumped on a chair crying. 129
00:24:49.46  But as soon as Wallander introduced himself she got up and started to make coffee. 130
00:24:54.20  The men sat down at the kitchen table. 131
00:24:57.90  Wallander saw the Christmas decorations still hanging in the window. 132
00:25:17.26  An old cat lay on the windowsill, staring at him without blinking. 133
00:25:24.49  He reached out his hand to pet it. 134
00:25:27.49 �He bites,� said Nystr�m. �He�s not much used to people. 135
00:25:36.22  Except for Hanna and me. 136
00:25:37.89 Kurt Wallander thought of his wife who had left him and wondered where to begin. 137
00:25:39.45  A bestial murder, he thought. And if we�re really unlucky, it�ll soon be a double murder. 138
00:25:46.38 Suddenly he had an idea. 139
00:25:49.42  He knocked on the kitchen window to get Nor�n�s attention.�Excuse me for a moment,� he said, getting up. 140
00:25:56.98 �The horse had both water and hay,� said Nor�n. 141
00:26:01.52  �There weren�t any other animals. 142
00:26:12.35 �See that someone goes over to the hospital,� said Wallander. 143
00:26:16.70  �In case she wakes up and says something. She must have seen everything. 144
00:26:21.73 Nor�n nodded.�Send somebody with good ears,� said Wallander. 145
00:26:50.84  �Preferably someone who can read lips. 146
00:26:52.71 When he came back into the kitchen he took off his overcoat and laid it on the kitchen sofa. 147
00:26:58.99 �Now tell me,� he said. �Tell me, and don�t leave anything out. Take your time. 148
00:27:06.95 After two cups of weak coffee he could see that neither Nystr�m nor his wife had anything significant to tell. 149
00:27:11.59  He got some of the chronology and the life story of the couple who had been attacked. 150
00:27:21.88 He had two questions left.�Do you know if they kept any large sums of money in the house?� he asked. 151
00:28:13.70 �No,� said Nystr�m. 152
00:28:20.00  �They put everything in the bank. 153
00:28:23.37  Their pensions too. And they weren�t rich. 154
00:28:26.13  When they sold off the fields and the animals and the machinery, they gave the money to their children. 155
00:28:30.56 The second question seemed meaningless to him. But he asked it anyway. 156
00:28:36.42  In this situation he had no choice.�Do you know if they had any enemies?� he asked. 157
00:28:41.27 �Enemies?�. 158
00:28:43.39 �Anybody who could have possibly done this?�. 159
00:28:45.12 They didn�t seem to understand his question. 160
00:28:47.22 He repeated it.The two old people looked at each other, uncomprehending. 161
00:28:50.77 �People like us don�t have any enemies,� the man replied. 162
00:28:53.44  Wallander noticed that he sounded offended. �Sometimes we quarrel with each other. 163
00:28:57.82  About maintaining a wagon path or the location of the pasture boundaries. 164
00:29:02.90  But we don�t kill each other.Wallander nodded. 165
00:29:29.54 �I�ll be in touch again soon,� he said, getting up with his coat in his hand. 166
00:29:31.91  �If you think of anything else, don�t hesitate to call the police. 167
00:29:34.75  Ask for me, Inspector Wallander.�What if they come back. 168
00:29:37.57 ?� asked the old woman.Wallander shook his head. 169
00:29:42.09 �They won�t be back,� he said. 170
00:29:45.23  �It was most likely robbers. 171
00:29:48.16  They never come back. 172
00:29:56.12  There�s nothing for you to worry about.He thought that he ought to say something more to reassure them. 173
00:30:10.31  But what? What security could he offer to people who had just seen their closest neighbor brutally murdered? Who had to wait and see whether a second person was going to die?. 174
00:30:13.37 �The horse,� he said. 175
00:30:16.40  �Who will give it hay?�.�We will,� replied the old man. 176
00:30:29.13  �We�ll see that she gets what she needs. 177
00:30:31.40 Wallander went outside into the cold dawn. 178
00:30:36.77  The wind had increased, and he hunched his shoulders as he walked toward his car. 179
00:30:42.49  Actually he ought to stay here and give the crime-scene technicians a hand. 180
00:30:51.06  But he was freezing and feeling lousy and didn�t want to stay any longer than necessary. 181
00:30:53.37  Besides, he saw through the window that it was Rydberg who had come with the team�s car. 182
00:30:59.57  That meant that the techs wouldn�t finish their work until they had turned over and inspected every lump of clay at the crime scene. 183
00:31:02.37  Rydberg, who was supposed to retire in a couple of years, was a passionate policeman. 184
00:31:07.47  Although he might appear pedantic and slow, his presence was a guarantee that a crime scene would be treated the way it should be. 185
00:31:16.01 Rydberg had rheumatism and used a cane. Now he came limping across the yard toward Wallander. 186
00:31:20.35 �It�s not pretty,� Rydberg said. 187
00:31:22.31  �It looks like a slaughterhouse in there. 188
00:31:25.74 �You�re not the first one to say that,� said Wallander. 189
00:31:28.69 Rydberg looked serious. �Have we got any leads?�. 190
00:31:32.28 Wallander shook his head. 191
00:31:45.74 �Nothing at all?� There was something of an entreaty in Rydberg�s voice. 192
00:31:51.43 �The neighbors didn�t hear or see anything. 193
00:32:02.78  I think it�s ordinary robbers.�You call this insane brutality ordinary?�. 194
00:32:07.47 Rydberg was upset, and Wallander regretted his choice of words. 195
00:32:09.94  �I meant, of course, that it was some particularly fiendish individuals who were at it last night. 196
00:32:14.31  The type who make their living picking out farms in solitary locations where lonely old people live. 197
00:32:17.04 �We�ve got to catch these guys,� said Rydberg. 198
00:32:23.86  �Before they strike again.�You�re right,� said Wallander. 199
00:32:26.69  �If we don�t catch anyone else this year, we�ve got to catch these guys. 200
00:32:29.80 He got into his car and drove off. 201
00:32:37.78  On the narrow farm road he almost collided with a car coming around a curve toward him at high speed. 202
00:32:42.93  He recognized the man driving. 203
00:32:50.23  It was a reporter who worked for one of the big national papers and always showed up whenever something of more than local interest happened in the Ystad area. 204
00:33:03.58 Wallander drove back and forth through Lenarp a few times. 205
00:33:09.28  There were lights in the windows, but no one was outside.What are they going to think when they find out? he wondered to himself. 206
00:33:12.12 He was feeling uneasy. 207
00:33:14.35  The discovery of the old woman with the noose around her neck had shaken him. 208
00:33:17.56  The cruelty of it was incomprehensible. Who would do something like that? Why not hit her over the head with an axe so it would all be over in an instant? Why torture her?. 209
00:33:42.82 He tried to plan the investigation in his head as he drove slowly through the little town. 210
00:33:46.07  At the crossroads toward Blentarp he stopped, turned up the heat in the car because he was cold, and then sat completely still, gazing off toward the horizon. 211
